<h1>How?</h1>
<p>
Uploaded pictures are first scanned for faces by <a href=http://libccv.org/>libccv</a>, then if possible cropped so that the top and edge of the found faces are clipped.  After that, it goes through some <a href=http://www.imagemagick.org/>ImageMagick</a> conversions to add camera shake and various camera-isn't-properly-configured effects.  Then it's uploaded to <a href=http://www.imgur.com/>imgur</a> and a hosting .html file is generated to display the result.
</p>
<h1>Why?</h1>
<p>
I was bored and needed to play around with some technology.  I wanted to gain familiarity with ImageMagick, Amazon EC2, form upload/download in node.js, and to test out some deployment mechanisms.
